Front-end web development is making order in chaos.

“We begin in admiration and end by organizing our disappointment.” &mdash; Frank Chimero and Gaston Bachelard.

"It’s gotten to where several of my peers are floating half-hearted speculations about their next careers." &mdash; Frank Chimero

Front-end code has to leverage what screens are capable and what designers want; it has to stay easily understandable and reusable; it has to be performant.

Front-end code and workflow changes from project to project. It is not driven by standards but culture. It has to adapt to the current stack yet deliver best practices.

Front-end development has no holy grail.
