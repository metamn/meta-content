Hello I'm Csongor Bartus--yes it's Hungarian--a web designer and developer from Europe.

I have a degree in Computer Science and I'm a self-taught designer. In the last couple of years I've merged from founding companies and building businesses to create web experiences which deliver the message.

Lately I've been working together with clients mostly from New York City on design, front-end development and Wordpress projects.

Please feel free to contact me via email (bartus.csongor@gmail.com), get the pulse on Twitter, or check my code on Github. I'm also running a blog on Tumblr and collected a few relevant articles fro you in Readability.
