"Visitors can focus only on five things on a single page."
&mdash; Jakob Nielsen, usability expert

With attention span so short user interfaces must be clean. No unnecesary elements just those driving attention from a focus point to another.

Going clear doesn't imply poor and forgettable, featureless design. It makes the design strong and the message delivered.

Design is meant to leave mark and trigger action.
